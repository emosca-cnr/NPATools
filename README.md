# NPATools - Tools for Network and Pathway analysis

The package contains functions to:
 - perform network diffusion on molecular networks;
 - obtain an X0 (input) matrix from gene expression data via kernel estimation;
 - normalize adjacency matrix;
 - normalize Xs (output) matrix;
 - calculate gene set scores from Xs;
 - permute X0;
 - create an enrichment map;
 - perform over-representation analysis (ORA);
 - perform gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA);
 - plot heatmap of multiple ORA/GSEA runs.
