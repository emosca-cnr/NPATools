# NPATools - Tools for Network and Pathway analysis

The package contains functions to:
 - perform network diffusion (ND) on molecular networks;
 - obtain ND input matrix X0 from gene expression data via kernel estimation;
 - permute the vertices of a graph, freely, conserving vertex degree and/or conserving disntinct vertex subsets;
 - normalize adjacency matrix;
 - normalize ND output matrix Xs;
 - calculate gene set scores from Xs;
 - create an enrichment map;
 - perform over-representation analysis (ORA);
 - perform gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA);
 - plot heatmaps of multiple ORA/GSEA runs.
